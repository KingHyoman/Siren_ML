# Emergency Vehicle Project

## Motivation
There was an accident that an ambulance collides with a bus in Korea<br/>
(link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BQaSOpQoHI)<br/>
Since the cause of an accident is a small sound (<=120 dB), this project creates a recognition technology for emergency vehicles.<br/>

## Idea
1. Sound Classification: Detecting the siren
2. Object Detection: Find the emergency vehicles using their image
<br/>
This repository has results for Sound Classification.<br/>
(The first attempt of Object Detection is also present => Later changed the ã…‡eep learning model to Yolov5)<br/>

## Results
1. Sound Classification: https://www.notion.so/Result-1-Sound-Classification-256f4600932c4a7481e56191e9463119?pvs=4<br/>
2. Object Detection: https://www.notion.so/Result-2-Object-Detection-572fa4ddf38a4739945838bd6e75cd8e?pvs=4
