# Emergency Vehicle Project

## Motivation
There was an accident that an ambulance collides with a bus<br/>
Since the cause of an accident is a small sound (<=120 dB), this project creates a recognition technology for emergency vehicles.<br/>

## Idea
1. Sound Classification: Detecting the siren
2. Object Detection: Find the emergency vehicles using their image
<br/>
This repository has results for 1.
